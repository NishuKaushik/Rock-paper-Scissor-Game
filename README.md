Rock Paper Scissors game

This project is designed to create an interactive, web-based experience where users can compete against the computer. Utilizing HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality, this project offers a simple yet engaging user interface. Users select one of three options—rock, paper, or scissors—while the computer randomly generates its choice. The game then determines the winner based on traditional rules and provides immediate feedback with dynamic messaging and updated scores.

This project features a responsive design, ensuring a visually appealing experience across devices. The implementation of game logic includes generating the computer's choice, comparing it with the user's choice, and displaying the outcome in real-time. This project serves as an excellent example of combining basic web development skills to create an enjoyable and educational game, showcasing event handling, conditional logic, and DOM manipulation in JavaScript.
